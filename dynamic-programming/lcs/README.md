# Overview
The [longest common subsequence problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem) is a good example of how dynamic programming can be employed to avoid the exponential running time of the brute force approach.

# Implementation details
This implementation supports an arbitrary number of input strings. The running time is <code>O(n1 x n2 ... x ni)</code>, where ni is the string length of the ith input string.
