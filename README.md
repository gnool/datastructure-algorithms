# Overview
This repository contains all my codes on data structure & algorithms related problems. Most of the problems are from the Coursera's specialization "Data Structure and Algorithms" set of advanced problems.

Coming from a background in C, I intend to use mainly Python 3 in solving these problems for several reasons:
- I really need to brush up my Python skills (especially on how to write efficient Pythonistic code)
- My main intention, at least when I am still working on this repository, is to learn data structures/algorithms, less about getting speed from lower-level languages such as C/C++.

I do, however, intend to work on C++ versions for the same reason on brushing up my horrible C++ skills.

# Disclaimer
These codes DO NOT represent the official solutions to the assignments in Coursera, although all these codes have successfully passed the grader (with max time taken well below the grader's max time limit). If you are taking this course and are planning to earn the certificate, I do request you to obey [Coursera's Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) and not to use my code.
