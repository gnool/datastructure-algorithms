# Overview
Here are some of the random algorithms implemented:
- Calculating Fn mod m, where Fn is the nth Fibonacci number with large n
    - *Involves Pisano period and modular arithmetic*
- Calculating last digit of the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers
    - *Involves Pisano period and modular arithmetic*
